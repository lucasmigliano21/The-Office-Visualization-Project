### The objective of this analysis is to understand if the decision of each yearly award was influenced by the results of the players in their clubs or in their national teams.

Once the data was treated, cleaned, enriched, transformed and became useful, we exported the files as .csv and worked on them in SQL.
You can find the queries in the following [link](https://github.com/lucasmigliano21/LM-Project3-ETL/tree/master/data#:~:text=women%20football%20analisis.sql). The analysis proves that more players were awarded when their national team had most won matches that year.
