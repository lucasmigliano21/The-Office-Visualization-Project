# The Office

### The objective is to offer some insights of the series to the fans!

For example, who was the character with more appearances? Which season, in average, was the most seen? And most rated? This and another questions are being answered in the following [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucas.german.migliano/viz/Libro1_16507074217200/Historia1).

In relation to the information, the datasets were taken from Kaggle:
1. [The Office Episodes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/the-office-episodes-data)
2. [The Office (US) - Complete Dialogue/Transcript](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasirkhalid24/the-office-us-complete-dialoguetranscript)


Once the data was treated, cleaned, enriched, transformed and became useful, we exported the files as .csv and worked on them in SQL.
You can find the queries in the following [link](https://github.com/lucasmigliano21/The-Office-Visualization-Project/blob/master/Data/Clean/office%20sql.sql).
